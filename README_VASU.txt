This is the ReadMe for my project assignment part 3. I wasnt sure if I had to make a seperate one or edit the already existing document.

My project is called Munchies. It is a mix of Pokemon and Pacman in which Munchlax wanders into a haunted house in search of food. He does find food but the Gastly inhabiting the house does as well!

I used many Video Tutorials for my project:

The main video help I got and where I got some art assets from:

There are a few bugs that I cant really get rid of, namely the tilemap colliger being a funky shape around the corners. If you get pinned into a corner by gastly it is near impossible to move after.
